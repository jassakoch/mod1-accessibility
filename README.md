# <Horiseon Website Accessibility Refactoring>

## Description

As a software developmer I have updated the  website code to meet accessibility standards. 
The website <div> elements were changed to proper semantic HTML elements. 
The elements were updated to follow a logical structure.
I have added accessible alt attributes to all image elements. 
The heading attributes were updated so that they fall in sequential order.
The title elements was updated to a concise, descriptive title.
